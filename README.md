# Go Concurrency Project

This project aims to provide a hands-on understanding of concurrency concepts and patterns in the Go programming language.

## Overview

Concurrency in Go is achieved through goroutines and channels. Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime, and channels are the primary means of communication between goroutines.

This project explores various concurrency patterns, including:

- **Fan-Out/Fan-In**: Distributing work across multiple goroutines (Fan-Out) and collecting the results (Fan-In).
- **Worker Pool**: Using a pool of workers to execute tasks concurrently.
- **Pipeline**: Chaining multiple stages of processing using channels.

## Project Structure

- **cmd/**: Contains the main applications or entry points for exploring different concurrency patterns.
- **internal/concurrency/**: Provides implementations of various concurrency patterns.

## Getting Started
